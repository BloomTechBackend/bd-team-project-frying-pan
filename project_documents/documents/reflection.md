# [Frying Pan] Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 

I had to stray from the design docment a lot. I kept it abstract as possible as this is my first time creating a full API project. Keep details of requirements and use cases help me keep track of what I needed to complete. My implementation of the backend code changed based on what inputs and outputs I needed to handle and return back. Once I completed the backend, linking up the code to the AWS api gate was difficult because I did not understand completely of how each pathway worked. For instance, I originally planned to use 4 total queries (4 total GSI's). In the final project, I only used 2. The other 2 were removed due to not understanding how the API path ways worked. This caused me to cut out two endpoints from my project. 

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

I used a lot of spreadsheets to create my project. First I created list of user stories on what users can do and the result that happens. Then I created my tables on the data that I need to store. I then created endpoints on what data needed to be inputted and outputted in order to satify each user story. From there, I referenced the document as I created the java classes for each request and response.    

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

Scrum helped identify blockers that I could not figre out on my own. In the past, I would spend an entire day trying to find the solutions for things I do not know myself. When ever I have blockers, I would quickly try to get in contact with LA's through slack or schedule appointments.  

I think I underestimated how much work I can completed each sprint. I have learned to basics of html, css and javascript before. However, this is my first time using the code in a full project. I over estimated my own knowledge. I thought I only needed to learn how to use javascript's axios methods. I realized that I needed to relearn the basics of frontend and debugging front end all over again. This would become frequent through out the project where I would come across many new experiences such as setting up the entire backend on dynamodb and the cloudformation with yaml/json, creating my own paths in API gateway, and linking up those pathways to javascript.  

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

I would definitly block out time to include learning and researching material. Learning many different sytax and code format really slowed me down. I learned to utilized ai (like perplexity, claude and openai/chatgpt) to help verify my formating. I would also reach out and get help faster. I struggled with API pathway design. As a result my current project's queries were not efficently linked my API pathwyas.
